I am a PhD student in the [4-year PhD programme](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sussexneuroscience/study/4yearphd) at Sussex University. I am doing my project in the [Brain Energy Lab](http://www.brainenergylab.com/) with Catherine Hall. I study place cells using two-photon microscopy and look how they respond to changes in a virtual reality environment. 

Outside the lab I like to write about science and diversity and inclusion in STEM. I write for [Massive Science](https://massivesci.com/) and other outlets.
